They share many similarities like extensions, settings &amp; integrations. However, they do have some notable differences.<br><br>Intelligence:<br>- Context awareness: <br>  - Cursor allows tagging specific files for context but you can also make a request for cursor to search the entire codebase. Sometimes it formats response differently or has trouble identifying relevant files.<br>  - Windsurf is better at identifying relevant files on its own without needing them tagged<br>- Output quality:  <br>  - Both receive a score of 7/10, with Cursor's autocomplete being more reliable and working well. But if dealing with large files, they may forget context and get confused.<br>  - Windsurf has worse output quality compared to Cursor<br><br>Autonomy (Agentic capabilities):<br>- Cursor: 2/10<br>- Windsurf: 6/10 (Windsurf excels here, able to find relevant files, pull in additional context, run terminal commands, etc. while keeping the developer in the loop)<br><br>Acceleration:<br>- Both score well on iteration size (7/10) - best at feature-level changes across multiple files<br>- Cursor has faster iteration speed with output code sooner <br>- Cursor wins for autocomplete efficiency in the weeds of modifying code<br>- Cursors capabilities edge out Windsurf, especially around customizing models &amp; docs<br><br>Experience:  <br>- Flexibility: 7/10 (Cursor)<br>- Ease of use: 5/10 (Cursor), 6/10 (Windsurf) <br>- Reliability: 8/10 (Cursor), 5/10 (Windsurf)<br><br>Pricing &amp; Value:<br>- Both have free tiers but require Pro Plan for most users<br>- Cursor $20/mo, Windsurf $10/mo<br>- Good value given time saved, especially at Cursor's $20 price point<br><br>In summary, Cursor is slightly better overall due to higher reliability and autocomplete effectiveness. But Windsurf offers competitive autonomous capabilities that may be worth the lower price point of $10/month. Both are strong tools in an increasingly crowded but still emerging AI code editor space.</p>",template:"post"},rootPath:"../../",headHtml:"<title>%item.title% - %site.title%</title>",footerHtml:"",sidebarHtml:"",vars:{}},{site:PRSSConfig}));ReactDOM.render(PRSSElement,document.getElementById("root"));</script></body></html>
