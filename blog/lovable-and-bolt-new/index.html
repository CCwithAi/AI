Fancy building your own slick SaaS website without forking out a fortune or needing a PhD in coding?  Yeah, thought so.  Well, yours truly and my tech-wizard mate Dave decided to chuck ourselves in the deep end and see if we could actually do it.  And guess what? We blummin' did!<br><br>Now, you might remember our last escapade – we had a crack at making a social media app with this thing called Lovable.  Went down a treat, it did. So, we thought, "Why not push it a bit further?".  This time, we were aiming for something a bit more… AI-y.  Because let’s be honest, if you're not shouting about AI in 2025, are you even trying?<br><br>This wasn't going to be some polished, pre-planned demo, mind you.  Nah, we wanted to show you the real deal – the raw, uncut, slightly chaotic journey of building something in public.  Think of it like watching us fumble around in a digital shed, occasionally hitting our thumbs with a hammer, but hopefully ending up with something halfway decent.<br><br>##  Agent Ahoy!  Our Brainwave Idea<br><br>So, what masterpiece were we attempting?  An AI agent marketplace!  Think of it like a LinkedIn, but instead of hiring Dave from accounts, you're hiring a digital agent to do… well, agent-y things.  Mark, being the brains of the operation, had the brilliant idea to loosely base it on this platform called agent.ai.  They’ve got a proper swanky setup, but we were aiming for a low-resolution, text-to-code version.  Keep it simple, keep it doable, that was the mantra.<br><br>##  The Secret Weapon: 21st.dev –  UI Magic, No Coding Grief<br><br>Here’s where things got interesting.  See, Lovable is ace, but sometimes the standard UI bits can be a bit… well, standard.  Enter Brock’s “crazy hack” –  21st.dev.  This website is like a treasure trove of UI templates generated by prompts.  Seriously, proper robust, not your cookie-cutter stuff.<br><br>Mark stumbled across this Tesla-style UI on there – all futuristic and swish.  Now, usually, getting something like that would involve hours of coding or begging a designer.  But with 21st.dev?  You just nick the prompt!  We literally copied and pasted the prompt straight into Lovable, told it we wanted a web app for agents, and blammo!  Tesla-esque UI appeared.  Mental, isn't it?<br><br>Okay, the buttons weren't actually *doing* anything yet, but blimey, it looked the part.  And let’s be honest, half the battle is looking like you know what you’re doing, right?<br><br>##  Landing Page Polish and Button Shenanigans<br><br>We weren't stopping there.  The initial UI was just a starting point.  We wanted a proper landing page, robot mascot and all.  So, we told Lovable to build us a full-blown landing page, keeping that swanky robot and the responsiveness, but adding bits to explain our AI agent marketplace concept.<br><br>And it delivered!  "AI Agents Marketplace," it proudly declared.  Not bad for a few lines of text.<br><br>Then came the buttons.  We spotted these cool, bordered buttons on another site and thought, "Ooh, fancy!"  So, back to the prompt we went.  "Can you make the 'Explore Agents' button in *this* style?"  Pasted the prompt, and boom, bordered button.  It's like magic, but without the pointy hats and dodgy rabbits.<br><br>We even ran into a bit of a hiccup with a button error.  Turns out, we’d accidentally created *two* explore agent buttons – one a proper button, the other just a… div-pretender.  Using Lovable's "select element" tool (proper handy, that), we spotted the imposter and told Lovable to bin it. Sorted.<br><br>##  Marketplace Mayhem –  Agents Galore (But No Actual Agents Yet)<br><br>Right, landing page looking sharp. Time to build the actual marketplace bit. We wanted a page that popped up when you clicked "Explore Agents," showing off our digital workforce.  Taking inspo from agent.ai again, we grabbed some screenshots of their agent marketplace and fed them to Lovable with a prompt:<br><br>"When you click 'Explore Agents,' new page, marketplace, agents, UI images attached, recreate 10 agents, icons, descriptions, 'Hire Me' button."<br><br>And again, Lovable didn't disappoint.  Ten agent cards appeared, complete with dodgy placeholder names nicked from somewhere on the internet (James three, anyone?).  A bit rough around the edges, mind.  Usernames we didn't want, descriptions too long, buttons doing nothing.  OCD nightmare fuel, basically.<br><br>So, list of changes time!  Like proper project managers, we listed out the tweaks: bin the usernames, shorter descriptions, neaten it up. Lovable, being the good digital dog it is, sorted it all out.  Much better.  OCD levels dropping.<br><br>##  Brain-in-a-Box Time: Hooking Up the AI Brains (GPT-4o, Naturally)<br><br>Looking good, but these agents were about as useful as a chocolate teapot.  Time to give them some brains!  We wanted to plug in OpenAI’s GPT-4o.  Mark, being the API key wizard, sorted that out, plugged it into Lovable, and told it to create an “edge function” (sounds proper sci-fi, doesn’t it?) to handle the OpenAI calls.<br><br>And blimey, it worked!  We tested it out on the "Competitor Analyst" agent.  Typed in "Brock" (that's me!), clicked "hire," and waited.  A few seconds later, boom!  Analysis of yours truly.  Spooky, but brilliant.<br><br>We tried the "Web Page Copy Editor" and "AI Content Generator" agents too.  All working, all powered by GPT-4o (or so we thought… more on that later).  These agents were actually *doing* stuff!  Mind officially blown.<br><br>##  Markdown Magic and Superbase Savvy<br><br>One snag – the responses from the AI were a bit… raw.  Hashtags everywhere, not formatted properly.  Looked a bit of a mess.  "Can you ensure all responses are formatted in markdown?" we asked Lovable.  Sorted!  Suddenly, lovely clean headers, much easier on the eye.<br><br>Then, we got all sensible and thought, "Should probably save this stuff, shouldn't we?"  Enter Superbase – the backend to our frontend masterpiece.  We told Lovable to store all the agent results in Superbase, timestamped and everything.  Generation history, at our fingertips!<br><br>Except… errors.  Of course, errors.  Wouldn't be a proper "building in public" video without a few gremlins in the machine.  Superbase threw a wobbly.  But, like true pros, we persevered, refreshed, and eventually, data started flowing into our Superbase table.  Result!<br><br>##  Prettying Things Up –  From Paint to Picasso (Almost)<br><br>Functionality? Check.  Aesthetics?  Slightly less check.  Our agent marketplace page was looking a bit… functional.  Compared to our swanky landing page, it was like comparing a Picasso to a painting done in five minutes with house paint.<br><br>Time for a UI makeover.  Remember that Tesla-style UI from 21st.dev?  We wanted to inject some of that style into our marketplace.  Mark, being the prompt-whisperer, went to ChatGPT and asked it to analyse the code from the Tesla UI and tell Lovable how to style our marketplace to match.<br><br>ChatGPT spat out some code.  We fed it to Lovable.  And… not quite what we expected.  Font changed, cards got hover effects, but not the sleek black and white vibe we were after.  Oops.<br><br>Plan B –  screenshot of the landing page!  Show, don’t just tell.  We showed Lovable a picture of our landing page and said, "Make the marketplace look like *this* – black and white, similar fonts, the works."<br><br>And bingo!  Much, *much* better.  Clean, consistent, actually looked like it belonged to the same website.  Phew.<br><br>##  Gradient Buttons and Grid Background –  Because Why Not?<br><br>Feeling brave (and slightly bonkers), we decided to push it even further.  Gradient buttons!  We’d seen some shiny, gradient buttons on 21st.dev and thought, "Let’s have some of *that*!"  Prompted Lovable to make all the "Hire" buttons gradient-y.  And… gradient buttons appeared!  Magic!<br><br>Then, because we were clearly on a roll, we thought, "Background! Needs a cool background!"  Back to 21st.dev, spotted a square grid background, nicked the prompt, told Lovable to stick it *behind* the agent cards.  And… grid background!  Suddenly, our marketplace had depth, dynamism, dare I say… *pizzazz*?<br><br>##  Navigation Nightmares and Dock to the Rescue<br><br>Deployed the site to take a proper look.  Landing page?  Lovely.  Marketplace?  Snazzy.  Navigation?  Non-existent.  Oops again.  No way to get back to the homepage from the marketplace.  Slight oversight.<br><br>Mark had a brainwave –  a dock!  Like those navigation bars you see at the bottom of apps.  Back to 21st.dev (are you sensing a theme here?), found a dock UI, grabbed the prompt, and told Lovable to stick a dock at the bottom of *every* page after the landing page, with a "Home" button and a dark/light mode toggle.<br><br>Dock appeared!  Home button worked!  Light/dark mode… mostly worked.  Changed the dock colours, but not the agent cards themselves.  Hmm.  Close enough.  We tweaked the prompt again, told Lovable to make sure the cards changed colour with the theme toggle.  And… background changed!  Cards… stayed stubbornly grey.  Ah well, can't have everything.  Good enough for jazz.<br><br>We even made sure the theme setting stuck when you navigated between pages.  Dark mode on the marketplace?  Dark mode on the agent pages too!  Clever little thing, Lovable.<br><br>##  Deployment, Reflection, and "Is it *really* GPT-4o?"<br><br>Deployed the site *again* (lost count how many times we’d deployed by this point).  Refreshed.  Landing page?  Robot still there, phew.  Explore agents?  Marketplace present and correct, dock at the bottom, gradients gleaming, grid background gridding.  Navigation working!  Theme switching… mostly working!<br><br>Success!  We’d actually built a functional (ish), decent-looking SaaS website in a couple of hours, without writing a single line of proper code.  Mental.<br><br>Oh, and about GPT-4o…  Remember we thought we were using it?  Turns out, Lovable might have sneakily switched us to GPT-4o *mini* without asking.  Sneaky!  Mark, ever the tech detective, could tell by the speed of the responses.  Too quick for proper GPT-4o.  We told Lovable to switch it back to the full-fat GPT-4o.  Hopefully, it listened.<br><br>##  Job Done (For Now)<br><br>So, there you have it.  Our whirlwind adventure in SaaS website building.  Did we build the next agent.ai?  Probably not.  But did we build a decent-looking, functional prototype in a couple of hours, using the power of text-to-web app builders and some clever prompting?  Absolutely!<br><br>Could we add payment systems, user logins, and all the proper bells and whistles?  Yeah, probably, with a bit more time (and maybe another video?).  But for now, we proved a point:  you don't need to be a coding ninja to build something pretty darn cool online.<br><br>Fancy giving it a go yourself?  Dive into Lovable, have a play with 21st.dev, and see what you can create!  And if you want to see more of our techy escapades (and maybe even a payment system integration video?), let us know in the comments!<br><br>And massive shoutout to Mark, the prompt-master himself!  Go check out his channel for more AI wizardry and prompting pro-tips.  You won't regret it.<br><br>Right, I’m off for a cuppa and a lie-down.  Building SaaS websites is surprisingly tiring, even when you don't actually code anything.  Catch you in the next one!</p></div></section><section class="mb-3"><h4 class="section-title explore-more"><span>Explore More</span></h4><div class=""><div class="card mb-3 d-flex flex-row has-img"><div class="col-2 p-0 explore-featured-image"><a class="card-img-left card-has-img" href="https://ccwithai.github.io/AI/blog/is-windsurf-editor-better-than-cursor-ai-42c36/"><img src="https://ccwithai.github.io/AI/assets/images/4262ae3ef7.png" loading="lazy"></a></div><div class="card-body col"><a class="card-title" href="https://ccwithai.github.io/AI/blog/is-windsurf-editor-better-than-cursor-ai-42c36/">Is Windsurf Editor Better Than Cursor AI?</a><p class="card-text">Cursor and Windsurf are both forks of VS Code runn...</p></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="page-footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col col-12 col-md-6"><span>© <!-- -->AI</span></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex justify-content-md-end"><a href="https://prss.io" class="d-flex align-items-center footer-shoutout" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Powered by PRSS Site Creator"><img class="prss-footer-image mr-1" src="data:image/png;base64,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" width="15"><span class="font-weight-bold prss-tag">PRSS Site Creator</span></a></div></div></div></footer></div></div>
